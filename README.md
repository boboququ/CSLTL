# CSLTL (TangyBot)

A bot that looks up teams and players for Collegiate Starleague Dota2 and provides draft information.

Currently deployed for Discord and previously deployed for Slack.


## How Do I Use TangyBot?

Complete details in [cli.py](https://github.com/boboququ/CSLTL/blob/master/cli.py) but here is a TLDR.

Tangybot Interacts with the user similar to a command line interface(CLI). There is functionality for looking up teams,

```
lookup ([--last] | <team_number>)
```

and looking up individual players through their steam profiles


```
profile ([--last] | [user_1, user_2, ...]) [--num_games (100)]
        [--max_heroes (5)] [--min_games (5)] [--tourney_only]
```
